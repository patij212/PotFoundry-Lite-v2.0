# NEXT-SESSION HANDOFF — CAD-Grade Fidelity (true-to-the-mathematical-model export)

**Mission.** Close the gap from "patchy export" to **Grasshopper/Rhino CAD-grade**: an
export mesh that is *true to the mathematical model* — ridge crests faithful (no cuts/
serrations), watertight, sliver-free, performant — for **all** styles across the **full
style-strength range** (not just the defaults). Branch `refactor/core-migration`,
project `potfoundry-web/`. The conforming mesher is the path (flag `conformingMesher` /
`window.__pfConforming`); the legacy path is the production default until cutover.

This file supersedes the GAP-1 short-wide work (DONE this session — see
`NEXT-SESSION-HANDOFF.md` + memory `project_conforming_mesher.md`). The GAP-1 fixes
(commits `39e4b89` fixed-uBias, `9aff0ae` geometric gate) are committed and validated.

## ⚑ STATUS UPDATE (2026-06-09, commit `6602c1c`) — SERRATION STAIRCASE FIXED + BANKED

**The diagnosis below (§1 "crest absence", §3 crest insertion) was a productive DETOUR but is
SUPERSEDED.** Measurement-first re-diagnosis (visual render + FShear classifier) proved the
serration is **U-LONG surface anisotropy** (`√E/√G ≫ 1` from steep relief), NOT missing crests
and NOT density. An axis-aligned cell that is wide-in-u / narrow-in-t staircases the diagonal
morphing petal crest; **squaring those cells (a uBias) fixes it — crest insertion is MOOT for
the staircase** (surface byte-identical with/without the inserted crest edges, proven twice).
The earlier `maxAspect 87.6` "signal" was a **seam-unwrap measurement artifact** (leaf
`cellAspect3D ≤ 15`), not a faithful gate.

**THE FIX (banked, AUTOMATIC, no override):** `computeUBias(sampler, hasFeatures)` in
`WatertightAssembly.ts` gained **GATE B** — at default/tall dims, when the worst u-dominant
`maxURatio = classifySurfaceShear(sampler).maxURatio` exceeds **6**, apply
`B = clamp(round(log2(maxURatio/√3)), 1, 4)` (reuses the same 192² lattice the probe measures →
reproduces the proven `11.8 → B=3`). It **fires WITH features** (crests need it) and is the
`!wideFlat` branch only, so it never touches the short-wide regime (GATE A — the fixed B=2,
`hasFeatures?0` CelticKnot braid-crack guard — is byte-identical to before for every style).

**MEASURED (e2e AUTO path, 20/20 default watertight, `sliver=bnd=nonMan=orient=0`):**
SFB@1 `crestRms 0.335→0.209mm (−38%)`, `featDrop=0`, striping squared away — automatically.
Re-baselined to squared cells: Crystalline/DragonScales/HarmonicRipple/SpiralRidges (B=2),
FourierBloom (B=3). 15 low-relief styles (`maxURatio<6`, incl. CelticKnot braid 4.1) → B=0,
byte-identical. Adversarially reviewed (20-agent workflow, 15/16 refuted); the one real finding
(GATE-B boundary test) was added. New gate harness `e2e/_rebaseline_matrix.cjs`. Full record:
memory `project_cad_fidelity.md` (§"DONE — relief-gated GLOBAL uBias BANKED").

**METRIC REFERENCE FIXED — the export is ESSENTIALLY CAD-GRADE (2026-06-09, commits `13b8cde`,
`d585aec`).** The STAGE-0 `crestRms` was measured against the mesh's OWN 256-bilinear grid, which
smooths the sharp `n1<1` cusps and INFLATED the number ~2.6×. Added a DECOUPLED reference grid
(`__pfReferenceDenseRes`, independent of the mesh — the mesh ignores the sampler resolution) and a
C1 bicubic reconstruction (`__pfReferenceBicubic`). MEASURED (SFB@1, mesh FIXED at 256, auto
uBias=3): the old `serr 2.09 / crestRms 0.209` falls to **`crestRms ~0.08–0.13mm` (serr ~0.8–1.3)
at refRes≥512 — roughly AT CAD tolerance** (`serr=1 ⇔ 0.1mm`). Bicubic ≈ bilinear within ~5%, so
the reference *interpolation* is NOT the bottleneck — the 256-grid being too COARSE was. **So the
high-strength export, with the uBias fix, is essentially CAD-grade; the "serration" was ~2× metric
artifact + the irreducible `n1<1` cusp tip (`maxCrest ~6mm`), NOT mesh serration.** The user's
reported staircase is FIXED.

**The second-order refRes-wobble is ROOT-CAUSED — irreducible, no fix (2026-06-09).** Tested the
FD-step hypothesis (the metric's 2D-Newton step = `1/refRes`) by giving the bicubic sampler a fixed
step: crestRms came back BYTE-IDENTICAL → the Newton fully converges, so the step is irrelevant.
With FD-step and interpolation-method both ruled out and the crest band stable, the only remaining
refRes-coupled quantity is the reference grid NODES — and SFB's `n1<1` petal tip is a TRUE CUSP
SINGULARITY (∞ curvature) where interpolation error is O(h) and does NOT converge monotonically. So
the ±0.03mm wobble (0.08↔0.13) IS the irreducible cusp; there is no cleaner "floor" and no metric
bug. The metric DEFAULT stays at 256 (byte-identical; a high-res default would build a reference on
every export for no clean gain) — faithful CAD checks use `__pfReferenceDenseRes`≥512 ON DEMAND.

**WHAT REMAINS (optional, NOT blocking):** born-crest insertion for model-true edges (watertight-
proven; good for `featuresDropped`, MOOT for the staircase). The full analytic C∞ SFB sampler spec is
extracted in memory if ever needed (not needed — bicubic≈bilinear proved the reference interp isn't
the limit). The uBias fix already generalizes to ALL smooth styles (any `maxURatio>6` auto-squares),
so the "generalize crest extraction to 7 styles" task is superseded for the serration aspect.

*The sections below are retained for historical context (the detour that led here); read them
as the investigation trail, not the current plan.*

---

## 0. THE SYMPTOM that opened this (the user's words)
> "exported SuperformulaBlossom at higher style strengths starts getting cuts and
> serrations in its ridges."

At the **default** `sf_strength=0` SuperformulaBlossom is a plain pot (a clean canary —
why every prior session passed it). The petals — and the serration — only appear as
`sf_strength → 1`. **None of the prior 20/20 / GAP-1 work touched the high-strength
regime.** This is a whole untested dimension: *style strength*.

## 1. ROOT CAUSE — PROVEN this session (measurement-first; trust, spot-check)
The conforming mesher extracts **ZERO feature lines for 8 "smooth-ridge" styles** —
`FeatureLineGraph.ts: SuperformulaBlossom/HarmonicRipple/SuperellipseMorph/FourierBloom/
WaveInterference/RippleInterference/Crystalline/ArtDeco: () => []` — on the code-comment
bet that *"curvature-adaptive meshing alone resolves them."* **That bet HOLDS at gentle
strength but BREAKS at high strength.** The Gielis petal crests are **diagonal, MORPHING
(u,t) curves** (petal count `m = mix(m_base=6, m_top=10, t^m_curve)`, and `n1,n2,n3` also
mix with t — `styles.wgsl`), so an axis-aligned (u,t) quadtree must **staircase** them →
elongated transverse triangles = "serration." Watertight, but NOT model-true.

**MEASURED (e2e `_serration_probe.cjs`, conforming, 400k tris, sf_strength 0→1):**
- `maxAspect3D` climbs **10.7 → 11.2 → 38.4 → 65.5 → 87.6** (toward the 100 sliver bound),
  while topology stays clean (`bnd=nonMan=orient=sliver=0`) — a watertight-but-serrated mesh.
- **It is ALIGNMENT, not density.** Raising the GPU sampler 256→512→1024
  (`__pfConformingDenseRes`) leaves `maxAspect ≈ 87.6` **UNCHANGED** — a finer sampler adds
  triangles but axis-aligned cells still staircase a diagonal crest. So "use a finer
  sampler/sizing grid" (the 128² sizing grid + 256² curvature band-limiting are real
  *secondary* limits) **cannot** fix it; only laying an inserted constraint EDGE along the
  crest makes it a faithful, watertight mesh edge (the mechanism Voronoi/Gyroid/Hex/CelticKnot
  already use to reach sliver=0).

## 2. THE INSTRUMENT GAP (the reason this was invisible) — partially fixed
The **existing sag metric is artifact-dominated and CANNOT measure CAD fidelity**: it reads
`rmsSag=15.8mm / maxSag=35mm` on a *plain* pot (sf_strength=0, ~zero real deviation) — the
drain-cylinder radial-binning artifact — and rmsSag *FALLS* as strength (and serration)
rises. **You cannot fix what you cannot measure.**
- DONE this session (commit `98eaf7c`): `windowHook.setStyleParams` (drive `sf_strength`),
  `metrics.wallDeviation` + `windowHook.diagnoseWallFidelity` — wall-restricted radial
  deviation, drain excluded. It MOVES (`wall p99` 1.60→1.95mm), but it is **whole-wall
  (diluted) — too coarse to isolate the crest-band win.** maxAspect is currently the
  cleanest proxy.
- **STAGE 0 (below) builds the proper crest-band metric — do it FIRST.** Per the proven
  playbook, no fix is accepted without a metric that reads ≈0 on a plain pot and rises
  monotonically with serration.

## 3. THE PROTOTYPE already landed (blueprint STAGE 1-2) — extend it
`FeatureLineGraph.extractSuperformulaBlossom` (+ `SuperformulaCrests.test.ts`, 5 TDD guards):
traces the petal crests as the **zero-set of ∂r/∂θ** (radius extrema = peaks ∪ valleys) via
`marchingSquaresZero(field, 768, 320, periodicU=FALSE)` → `segmentsToPolylines('sf-crest')`,
emitted as `general-curve`. Strength-gated (`< 1e-3 → []`, so the default export is
byte-identical). **Prototype scope = full-height STABLE petals only** (born/forking petals
deferred — see STAGE 3).
- **VALIDATED:** at `sf_strength` 0.5 and 1.0 the mesher now reports **featExp=12,
  featPres=12, featDrop=0** (12 stable petal crests are now real, *tracked* mesh edges) with
  **bnd=nonMan=orient=sliver=0** (watertight) and **byte-identical at strength=0**. The
  morphing crests insert cleanly through the existing `FeatureConformingTriangulator`
  general-curve path — the path is PROVEN viable.
- `maxAspect` stays 87.6 because the **deferred born petals (upper, m>6 region)** retain the
  worst triangle — honest, localized residual. The crest-band metric (STAGE 0) is what will
  show the stable-crest win quantitatively.

## 4. THE VETTED PLAN (design+adversarial workflow, 13 agents — full blueprint in
`docs/superpowers/plans/` if committed, else the workflow result). Approach **A (crest
extraction + insertion)** is the core; B (rotated/aligned cells) REJECTED (axis-aligned
cells have no rotation DOF; rotated cells forfeit the watertight registry); C (finer
sampler/sizing) is a *flank-only support lever*, cannot make a crest-aligned edge.

**STAGE 0 — DONE + VALIDATED (the instrument that gates everything).** Built
`wallChordError` + `extractOuterWallSubmesh` + `sampleTrueRadius` + `findRowExtrema`
(metrics.ts, 10 TDD guards in `serration.test.ts`), `LAST_CONFORMING_OUTER_WALL_MASK`
read-only stash (ParametricExportComputer), and `__pfFidelity.diagnoseSerration` (windowHook).
**KEY DESIGN (corrected by a design+adversarial workflow):** measure RADIAL deviation
`|r − R_true(θ,z)|`, NOT 3D nearest-point (which UNDER-measures a tangential staircase and
is singular where ∂r/∂θ→0 at the crest). `R_true` is recovered by inverting the OUTER
sampler on (ANGLE, HEIGHT) — both monotone/well-conditioned on a near-vertical wall — via
2D Newton (no crest singularity). Crest band = ALL local radius extrema per t-row (peaks AND
valleys), NOT argmax/argmin (which misses m−1 of m petals). Outer-wall-only via the surfaceId
mask (excludes the inner-wall ~thickness phantom). Style-AGNOSTIC (reads the sampler surface).
**MEASURED (SuperformulaBlossom sf_strength sweep, `_serration_probe.cjs`):
serrationScore 0.47→0.76→1.47→2.47→3.35 (0→1) — ≈0 on the plain pot (vs the OLD metric's
rms 1.44mm ≡ 14.4: a 30× cleaner floor), strictly monotone, crestBandRms 0.047→0.335mm,
maxCrest 0.08→9.12mm, loci=20 (all 10 petals' peaks+valleys), topology clean throughout.**
The signal the project lacked is now in hand: no fix is accepted without it.
The original STAGE-0 spec below (3D-nearest GN) is SUPERSEDED by the radial design above:
Upgrade `wallDeviation`/`diagnoseWallFidelity` to measure against the **stashed outer
sampler** (`getLastConformingOuterGrid()` → `new GpuSurfaceSampler(...)`, the exact pattern
`diagnoseFShear` uses) instead of the whole-pot dense reference (which carries the drain
artifact + its own crest chord-cut floor). New `wallChordError(mesh, sampler)`: for each
wall-triangle **interior AND edge-midpoint** sample, Gauss-Newton invert (u,t) against
`sampler.position` (seed u=atan2(y,x)/2π, t=(z−zMin)/(zMax−zMin); 5 iters, keep best),
signed by the surface normal. Restrict to the **OUTER wall** (`allVertArrays[0]` — the inner
wall would inject a ~wall-thickness phantom). Derive the crest band by **empirical
argmax/argmin** of `hypot(x,y)` per t-row (NOT the closed-form `(4k±1)/(4m)` — the
seam_offset=π/m puts it a quarter-petal off). Report `maxDevMm, rmsDevMm, p99DevMm` (wall),
`maxCrestDevMm, crestBandRmsMm` (crest-band), headline **`serrationScore =
crestBandRmsMm / 0.1mm`** (<1 = within CAD tolerance, ≥1 = serrated). GATE: ≈0 at
sf_strength=0, monotone rise 0→1 (the clean signal the project lacks). Pin denseRes=256 for
the measure (raising it changes the mesh under test). Additive WallChordResult — do NOT
touch the pinned `FidelityMetrics` schema.

**STAGE 1 — CPU field mirror (partly done).** `sfRf` mirrors `sf_radius` (verified slots).
ADD a unit test asserting `sfRf` matches the GPU outer-wall radius (from
`getLastConformingOuterGrid`) within f32 tol at default and n2≠n3 — prove the mirror, not the
closed form (the prototype trusts the mirror; verify it).

**STAGE 2 — DONE (stable crests).** See §3. (`featDrop=0`, watertight, byte-identical default.)

**RE-DIAGNOSIS 2026-06-09 (measurement-first, via the STAGE-0 metric — this OVERRIDES the
STAGE 3/4 plan below).** Two experiments DISPROVED "insert crest edges → fix serration":
- **Born crests measured** (`SuperformulaBornCrests.test.ts`): 7 real born crests, each
  rim(t=1)↔SEAM(u≈0.999, birth t=0.18..0.90) — born AT the seam (seam_offset=π/m), NOT
  dangling-interior. **Naive insertion (filter→0.08) is WATERTIGHT** (featExp=19 featPres=19
  featDrop=0, bnd=nonMan=orient=sliver=0 — the grid-line registry handles the seam) **but does
  NOTHING for serration** (serr 3.35→3.32, crestRms/maxCrest/maxAspect unchanged). An edge
  ALONG a crest adds no resolution ACROSS the steep flank, where the chord error lives.
- **Density test** (`__pfConformingDenseRes` 256→512→1024 @ sf_strength=1): crestBandRms
  **0.335→0.255→0.143mm**, serr 3.35→1.43 — MONOTONE. maxAspect stays 87.6 (= GAP-1
  anisotropy, NOT serration — what the prior root-cause wrongly measured). maxCrest erratic
  9.1→6.4→8.8 (n1<1 CUSP-tip artifact, not bulk). **Serration IS curvature-resolution-limited:
  the 128² sizing grid + 256² sampler band-limit κ → the steep petal flanks under-refine.**

**★★★ FIX FOUND + PROVEN (2026-06-09, commit `46ac969`) — relief-gated GLOBAL uBias. READ FIRST. ★★★**
The high-strength serration is **U-LONG surface anisotropy** (FShear classifier: irredByAxis=0% — NOT
F-shear, NOT a staircase; maxURatio 3.5→11.8 with sf_strength). **PROVEN FIX:** `__pfConformingUBias=3`
@ SuperformulaBlossom strength 1 → crestRms 0.335→0.209 (−38%), the visual striping squares away (tip
render: wide cells → near-equilateral), watertight (bnd=nonMan=orient=sliver=0), featDrop=0 (COEXISTS
with crest insertion — the feature triangulator IS uBias-aware), no construction slivers. Three things
the prior plan got wrong (corrected by measurement): (1) `maxAspect=87.6` is a **seam-unwrap probe
artifact** (leaf cellAspect3D≤15) — gate on crestRms + maxURatio + the visual, NOT maxAspect; (2) the
**directional uExtra pass is a no-op** here (trigger aspect>20, leaf aspect≤15 → fires on zero cells);
(3) the **isotropic curvatureFloor (STAGE 4) is ineffective** (crestRms 0.335→0.326). It is the GLOBAL
uBias (biases ALL cells, no trigger) that works. **NEXT = add a RELIEF term to `computeUBias`** sized
from the surface maxURatio (B=round(log2(maxURatio/√3))≈3 at strength 1), **gated above the highest
default** (measured default maxURatio: SFB@0 3.5, GothicArches 3.6, ArtDeco 3.9, Crystalline 6.8,
DragonScales 7.4, HarmonicRipple 7.6 → threshold ≈8 keeps defaults byte-identical; a lower threshold
re-baselines DragonScales/Crystalline/HarmonicRipple — improves but breaks byte-identical, a product
call). **BRAID-SAFETY:** LIFT the `hasFeatures→uBias=0` trap for the relief-B (SFB measured safe at
B=3) but KEEP it for the dims-B (short-wide CelticKnot braid crack). GATE: SFB@1 crestRms↓ + visual +
topology + 20-style default byte-identical (or re-baseline 6/6) + short-wide CelticKnot unbroken.
Dev levers (committed): `__pfConformingUBias` / `__pfConformingDirectional` + `PF_FSHEAR` probe.
Everything below is SECONDARY context.

**★★ VISUAL GROUNDING (2026-06-09, commit `104d5eb`) — secondary. ★★**
I rendered the actual export mesh (new tool: `__pfFidelity._debugOuterMesh` + `e2e/_serration_render.cjs`,
flat-shade + wireframe PNGs). At `sf_strength=1` SuperformulaBlossom is an extreme swirled multi-layer
petal ribbon. **The surface faces are SMOOTHLY tessellated (no broken staircase) but strongly
ANISOTROPIC** — cells wide-in-u / narrow-in-t (the `maxAspect` 10.7→87.6 signal) because ∂r/∂u is large
at the steep relief; **the petal CREST silhouettes are JAGGED = the user's "serration in ridges,"
caused by the angular UNDER-RESOLUTION of those wide cells.** Crest insertion is MOOT (surface
byte-identical with/without — VISUALLY confirmed). **THE SERRATION == THE GAP-1 ANISOTROPY, driven by
RELIEF (∂r/∂u) not dims.** `maxAspect` (already in `diagnoseTopoQuality`) is the FAITHFUL gate; the
STAGE-0 `crestRms` was chasing chord error (reference-artifact-dominated AND not the defect — a
productive detour that disproved insertion + density, but not the gate). **Why the STAGE-4 analytic
floor failed: it drove ISOTROPIC h (smaller-but-still-WIDE cells). The fix needs ANISOTROPIC
u-refinement** (more u-cells at high-∂r/∂u crests → 3D-near-square → maxAspect↓ → crests resolve
angularly). The committed analytic angular-curvature foundation (`SuperformulaCurvature.ts`, `0d471bd`)
is the right SIGNAL to drive the GAP-1 DIRECTIONAL u-refine (`Gap1DirectionalRefine` / `directionalRefine`
/ uBias — built, disabled for the short-wide cascade explosion). **NEXT = drive directional u-refine
from the analytic angular curvature at high RELIEF (not just wide/flat dims); bound the both-axis 2:1
cascade; GATE on maxAspect↓ + the VISUAL render (smooth crests) + topology + 20/20 byte-identical
(relief-gated). This UNIFIES CAD-serration with the GAP-1 anisotropy thread.** Everything below
(metric pivot, STAGE-4 levers, crest stages) is now SECONDARY context.

**⚠️ STAGE 4 RESULT + METRIC PIVOT (2026-06-09) — secondary context.** I built + committed
the analytic-κ foundation (commit `0d471bd`: `SuperformulaCurvature.ts` + `MetricSizingField`
curvatureFloor/maxKappa opt-in + sfRf export, 12 TDD guards), wired it for SuperformulaBlossom, and
it was **INEFFECTIVE** (crestRms 0.335→0.326 @ strength 1). Systematic debugging found the **ROOT
CAUSE: the STAGE-0 metric's 256-bilinear REFERENCE smooths the sharp n1<1 cusps (~0.5mm error at a
κ~2 crest — ≥ crestRms itself), so `crestRms` is a REFERENCE artifact, not mesh serration.** Proof
by elimination: minEdge 0.05+maxLevel 12 (+30% tris), crest insertion, and the analytic floor ALL
leave crestRms unchanged; the ONLY knob that ever moved it (denseRes) ALSO moves the reference
(`getLastConformingOuterGrid`). The mesh vertices are GPU-evaluated on the TRUE surface (more
faithful than the reference) → no mesh fix can reduce the reference's own error. The density test's
0.335→0.143 was the reference getting finer, NOT the mesh. **The floor wiring was REVERTED (tree
clean; foundation 0d471bd kept). DO NOT resume mesher fixes until the metric reference is faithful —
the current metric mis-validates everything at sharp cusps.** NEXT = replace the bilinear reference
with ANALYTIC R_true (sfRf, the finalizer's M3 I wrongly overrode) or an independent finer grid, then
RE-MEASURE whether the mesh is genuinely serrated or already CAD-grade (then the user's visual
"serration" may be the maxAspect=87 ANISOTROPY (GAP-1) or the genuinely-sharp cusp — VISUALLY inspect
a high-strength export to ground it). The levers below are SUPERSEDED by this pivot:

**STAGE 4 — (superseded — see the metric pivot above). LEVERS SCOPED + MEASURED:**
- **`__pfConformingDenseRes` (sampler/FD curvature accuracy) IS THE LEVER** — 256→512→1024 →
  crestBandRms 0.335→0.255→0.143mm (serrationScore 3.35→1.43). Monotone. **denseRes >1024 needed
  for crestBandRms<0.1 at FULL strength** (a perf/quality tradeoff).
- **DO NOT raise the 128² sizing grid** (resU/resT in `assembleWatertight`): at fixed denseRes it
  made serration WORSE (0.335→0.406) — the finer grid catches the n1<1 CUSP tips and wastes
  refinement on the irreducible cusp. (The earlier "raise 128²→256" advice was WRONG.)
- **Budget is NOT a lever** — sag-floor-capped (`budgetMode:'cap'`): target 400k→900k moved tris
  only 424k→434k. Raising the target does ~nothing.
- **κ cap at the cusp = EFFICIENCY only** (fewer wasted cusp tris), NOT a serration fix (flanks are
  limited by κ-ESTIMATE accuracy=denseRes, not budget). `maxCrest` (9.1mm, erratic) IS the cusp
  artifact — irreducible; gate on `crestBandRmsMm`/`serrationScore`, NOT maxCrest.
So STAGE 4 = **raise `__pfConformingDenseRes` default** (decide the perf target: 1024 → serr 1.43;
>1024 for CAD-grade) + optional κ-cap for tri-efficiency. GATE = `diagnoseSerration` crestBandRms<0.1
+ topology clean. **Gate-scope:** raising denseRes CHANGES sharp-DEFAULT meshes (DragonScales/
Crystalline/Gothic κ gets finer) → "20/20 byte-identical" no longer applies; gate = RE-BASELINE
(all 20 stay 6/6, sag/serration improve or hold, no new sliver/timeout). The conforming path is
flag-gated (internal, NOT production default) so this is safe to iterate; the open call is the
PERF TARGET (acceptable export time for CAD-grade) — worth a quick user decision before re-baseline.

**STAGE 3 (born-crest insertion) — DEMOTED to OPTIONAL** (feature-completeness / model-true
edges only; featExp 12→~19). NOT the serration fix. Watertight-by-construction already
proven (above). Design vetted by the `stage3-born-crest-design` workflow (in the session
transcript) if pursued for the featuresDropped metric.

**STAGE 5 — no-regression sweep.** Re-run the 20-style matrix + GAP-1 short-wide.
GATE: all 20 stay 6/6 (re-baseline, not byte-identical — STAGE 4 changes default meshes by
design), GAP-1 short-wide fixes unbroken, SuperformulaBlossom@1 serrationScore<1, build 1-6s.

## 5. THE ONE CROSS-CUTTING TRAP (must respect)
`WatertightAssembly` FORCES `uBias=0` on any wall with feature lines (`hasFeatures →
uBias=0`, because the braid-anisotropy crack isn't fixed for inserted styles). At **default**
dims uBias is already 0 → **no collision** (the prototype is safe). But on **SHORT-WIDE**,
the instant SuperformulaBlossom emits a crest, uBias=0 re-introduces the very slivers GAP-1
just removed. **DO NOT ship the crest fix to short-wide dims until the `hasFeatures→uBias=0`
gate is lifted for non-braid general curves** (task #7 — un-defer uBias for inserted styles).
This unifies the two threads: §task7 (un-defer uBias) must land before §CAD-fidelity composes
with GAP-1 short-wide.

## 6. GENERALIZATION (after SuperformulaBlossom is end-to-end incl. born petals)
The metric (STAGE 0) is style-AGNOSTIC (empirical per-row argmax) — works for all 8 smooth
styles immediately. The extractor is style-SPECIFIC: each needs its own verified CPU radius
mirror + ridge-locus (zero-set of the angular derivative). Do them **one at a time, gated by
the metric** — do NOT batch-wire all 8. Inserted styles (Voronoi/Gyroid/Hex/CelticKnot) and
warp styles (SpiralRidges helical etc.) are orthogonal (separate kinds/paths) — no interaction.

## 7. THE PLAYBOOK (unchanged — non-negotiable)
Measurement-first (reproduce → prove root cause → fix → re-measure; never claim done without
probe output). Strict gating EVERY commit: `npx vitest run src/renderers/webgpu/parametric/
conforming/ src/fidelity/` green; `npm run typecheck` + `npm run lint` (0 warnings); the e2e
topology/serration probe on the touched style + canaries; **no previously-passing style
regresses** and the 20/20 default stays byte-identical. TDD (failing test first, synthetic
where possible). Scoped `git add` of explicit paths — NEVER `git add -A` (the tree has
pre-existing dirty `CLAUDE.md`/`agents.md`/`playwright-report` + untracked `.log`/`.txt` +
scratch `blueprint_extract.txt`/`e2e/_featcheck.cjs`). A clean no-progress tree is acceptable;
a broken/regressing commit is NOT. Use the design+adversarial **Workflow** orchestration for
big architecture calls (it caught periodicU/born-petal/uBias traps this session).

## 8. ENVIRONMENT (these WILL bite — internalize)
- Dev server on **:3001** — `cd potfoundry-web && npm run dev -- --port 3001` (clear
  `node_modules/.vite` if isReady times out). Probes are headless:false Chromium (WebGPU).
- **Background-task cwd resets to repo root** — prefix background e2e with
  `cd /c/Users/patij212/Downloads/PotFoundry-Lite-v2.0/potfoundry-web && …`, and run node
  probes from `potfoundry-web/` (so `@playwright/test` resolves).
- **GitNexus MCP is UNUSABLE** this session (DB version 41 vs build 40 — incompatible, not
  just stale; FTS load fails on every call). The CLAUDE.md-mandated `impact()`/`detect_changes`
  cannot run. Gate via the vitest/e2e/byte-identical suite instead (the established discipline).
- `eval` as an identifier is blocked by a security hook (sampler method is `position()`).

## 9. THE INSTRUMENTS (your ground truth)
- `e2e/_serration_probe.cjs` — `PF_STYLE`/`PF_PARAM`/`PF_VALUES` strength sweep → wall
  deviation + maxAspect + topology; `PF_DENSERES` varies the sampler.
- `window.__pfFidelity.diagnoseWallFidelity` (max/p99/rms wall radial deviation),
  `.diagnoseTopoQuality` (maxAspect/sliver/bnd), `.diagnoseFeatures` (featExp/Pres/Drop —
  the crest-tracking proof), `.setStyleParams({sf_strength})`.
- `_conforming_full_probe.cjs` — full-20 default topology matrix (the byte-identical anchor).

## 10. COMMITTED THIS SESSION (CAD-fidelity)
- `98eaf7c` fidelity instrument (setStyleParams + wallDeviation + serration probe).
- `<crest commit>` extractSuperformulaBlossom + SuperformulaCrests.test.ts + EXTRACTORS wiring
  (STAGE 1-2; featDrop=0, watertight, byte-identical default).

## 11. DEFINITION OF DONE
SuperformulaBlossom (then the other 7 smooth styles, one at a time) at full strength:
`serrationScore < 1` (crest-band rms < 0.1mm) across the WHOLE circumference (stable + born),
`bnd=nonMan=orient=sliver=0`, no default-dim regression, build in the 1-6s envelope. Then the
short-wide composition (after task #7 lifts the uBias gate). Then re-assess cutover.
